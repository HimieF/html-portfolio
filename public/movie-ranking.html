<p> Fede Alvarez, we pouring honey on you 🐐. 
 This was an amazing time at the theater. When things get going, things get GOING. I was engaged the whole time and as someone who had only seen Prometheus (and didn’t like it) I loved this. Absolute thriller 🔥🔥
</p>
<h3>2. Twisters </h3>

 <p>Genuine fun time at the movies. 
    Had a great time all-around and was never bored with this one at all. 
    This is how you do a summer blockbuster. </p>
 <h3>3. Sing Sing </h3>

 <p>Just a beautiful film. You can feel the love and intention in this one. 
    Incredible performances and a touching story. 
    Glad I got to finally see this one. 
    When the credits hit and you see all of the cast members who are personally involved in this story I don’t know how anyone could not moved by this one. 
    One of the best of 2024.</p>
 <h3> 4. Didi </h3>

 <p>Despite traffic making me miss the first 20 minutes, I really enjoyed this movie. 
    Hilariously entertaining coming-of-age tale that makes some interesting choices in terms of the protagonist dealing with his decisions. 
    It was frustrating to watch Wang as the protagonist due to the nostalgia of being that age once and remembering the emotions and thinking I had in my youth and that’s what made it so effective. 
    Will definitely watch this again 🔥</p>
 <h3>5. Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</h3>
 <img src="../assets/images/Furiosa.jpg"width="200" height="300">
 <p>Had a lot of fun with this one. 
    Hemsworth really showed out here. 
    Not as great as Fury Road but definitely had its moments. 
    Enjoyed this a lot.</p>
